## Authors

*(fill-in line below with group identifier e.g. A07 or T22; and then delete this line)*  
**Group CXX**

### Code identification

In all the source files (including POMs), please replace __A07__ with your group identifier.  
The group identifier is composed by Campus - A (Alameda) or T (Tagus) - and number - always with two digits.  
This change is important for code dependency management, to make sure that your code runs using the correct components and not someone else's.

## Getting Started

The overall system is composed of multiple modules.
The main server is the _silo_.
The clients are the _eye_ and _spotter_.

See the [project statement](https://github.com/tecnico-distsys/Sauron/blob/master/README.md) for a full description of the domain and the system.

### Prerequisites

Java Developer Kit 11 is required running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have them installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```

### Installing

To compile and install all modules:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The integration tests are skipped because they require the servers to be running.
